# Using flask i have made an airline price predictor application

## Overview

This repository contains the materials and code for Session 8 of the Flask Course, which focuses on deploying machine learning models using Flask. In this session, we developed a project to predict flight prices. The session covered interpreting learning curves, evaluating and selecting models, creating a web application with Flask, and deploying the app using Render.

## Project Details

### Learning Curves and Model Evaluation

- **Understanding Learning Curves**: We explored how learning curves can be used to identify underfitting and overfitting in models.
- **Model Selection**: We used learning curves to evaluate various models and select the best-performing one for our flight price prediction task.

### API Serving and Deployment

- **Model Serving**: The trained machine learning model was served as an API using Flask.
- **Deployment**: The final Flask application was deployed using Render, making the web app accessible online.
